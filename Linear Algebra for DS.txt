Linear Algebra course
**WEEK_1**
Systems of Sentences:
	System1:		System2:
	The dog is black            The dog is black	
	The cat is orange	    The dog is black
	The bird is red		    The bird is red
	=> complete		    => redundant
	=> non-singular		    => singular

	System3:		System4:
	The dog is black            The dog is black	
	The dog is black	    The dog is white
	The dog is black 	    The bird is red
	=> redundant	   	    => contradictory
	=> singular		    => Singular

	Unique Solution:
	Non-Singular and complete
	a + b  = 10
	a + 2b = 12
	a = 10 - b	
	10 - b  +2b = 12
	b = 12 - 10
	b = 2
	a = 10 - 2
	a = 8	
	checK:
	8 + 4 = 12 (correct)
	8 + 2 = 10 (correct)
	intersects only 1's so unique solution
	Redundant System => infinite many solution => Singular
	apply = 5 , banana  = 5 also work etc
	a + b = 10
	2a + 2b = 20
	a =  b - 10
	2(b - 10) + 2b = 20
	2b - 20 + 2b = 20
	4b = 40
	b = 10
	a = 0
	infinite many dots as intersect infinite time
	not enough information => singular => contradictory => no solution

	a + b = 10
	2a + 2b = 24
	a = 10 - b
	20 - 2b +2b = 24
	Parallel Lines
	

	Quiz:
	3a + 2b = 8
	2a - b = 3
	=> 2a - 3 = b
	3a + 2 ( 2a - 3 ) = 8
	3a + 4a - 6 = 8
	7a = 8 + 6
	7a = 14
	a = 2
	b = 1
	=> non-singular and unique also
	
	Singular Vs Non-Singular:
		Linear Dep vs Linear InDep:
			if one row is mulitple of another then it is linear dep and singular too
	The determinant:
		a	b
		c	d
		matrix is singular if:
			ab *k =  cd
			ak = c ; bk = d
			a/c = k ; b/d = k
			a/c = b/d = k
			ad = bc 
			ad - bc = 0
			if det == 0:
				matrix => singular 
**WEEK_2**	
	System of equations (3x3):
		a + b + c = 10
		a + 2b + c = 15
		a + b + 2c = 12
		
		c = 10 - b - a
		
		a + 2b + 10 - b - a = 15
		b = 15 - 10
		b = 5

		
		b = 10 - c - a
		
		a + 10 - c - a + 2c = 12
		c = 12 - 10
		c = 2

	Question:
		a + b + c = 10
		a + b +	2c = 15
		a + b + 3c = 20

		
		a = 10 - b - c
		
		10 - b - c + b + 2c = 15
		c = 5
		
		b = 10 - a - c
		a + 10 -a - c - 3c = 20
		only get c

		c = 10 - a - b
		
		a + b + 2 ( 10 - a - b) = 15
		a + b + 20 - 2a - 2b = 15
		-a  -b + 20 = 15
	Question:
		c = 10 - a - b
		a + b + 2 ( 10 - a - b ) = 15
		a + b + 20 - 2a - 2b = 15
		- a - b = -5
		a + b = 5
		b  = 5 - a
		a + 5 - a + 2c = 15
		c = 5
	Singular vs non-singular matrices (3x3):
		- constant doesn't matter for singularity
		- uniq -> singluar -> complete
	Linear dependence and independence (3x3):
		row1 +row2 = row3
		so row3 dep on row1 and row2
		dep-> singular
		nondep-> nonsingular
	The determinant (3x3):
	Solving non-singular system of linear equations:
		Manipulating Equations:
			For 3 equations:
				use 1st and 2nd to remove a
				use 2nd and 3rd to remove b from eq 2 and get value of c 
				then back substitution
	Matrix Row Reduction:
		Elimination Method =? Echelon Form 
		Rank Of Matrix:
		rank of a matrix in general:
		Row echelon form in general:
**WEEK_3**

	Orthogonal vector's dot prod always zero
	identity matrix * any matrix gives the same matrix 
	Matrix Inverse:
	Which matrices have an inverse?:
		Non-Singular matrix => Inverse possible => Invertible Matrix
		Singular matrix =>  Inverse impossible => Non-Invertible Matrix
		
**WEEK_4**
	Singularity and rank of linear transformations:
		Non-Singular => whole plane to whole plane => Dim 2
		Singular => Rank 1 => whole plane to line => Dim 1
		Singular => Rank 2=> whole plane to dot => Dim 0
	Determinant as an Area:
		Det = 0 => Singular => Area/Vol = 0
	Determinant of a product:
		Area blows up to the factor by determinant
			if det = 3 and first area is 2 then it transfor to  area of 6 
		det(AB)=det(A)â‹…det(B), if either A or B has determinant 0 (singular), it will vanish the product, therefore det(AB)=0 and the resulting matrix is singular.
	Determinants of inverses:
		det (A^-1) = 1 / det(A)
	 Bases in Linear Algebra:
	 Span in Linear Algebra:
		Basis is minimal spanning set
			1 element: Dimension 1
			2 element: Dimension 2
	Eigenbases:
	Eigenvalues and eigenvectors:
		finding eigen values:
			O = matrix - eigen matrix
			det(O)
